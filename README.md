# What?
Free95 is your friendly Windows Environment with an added trust of the open source community, all your favorite games, applications and such from Windows will run perfectly fine on Free95 aswell! It is **NOT** a recreation of the NT Kernel, it simply supports apps using the Win32 API (like .exe files)

# Why?
To remove Windows's bloat, and security problems. Being controlled by a large corporation is unsettling.

# How?
By NT Syscalls, Win32 API Implementation, etc.

# How can i join this project?
You can join this project by simply doing so, literally. Just create a pull request, unless you have discord, in which case you can DM dripkap_19416 to join and communicate with other developers of the project.

# Running releases
You can either compile the Operating System from source, (running ``` make ``` in free95/) or downloading a binary from the Releases section.
